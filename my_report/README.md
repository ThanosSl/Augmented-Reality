# Introduction

# Summary


# 1st Deliverable
* At first, I downloaded Atom and I linked my GitHub account so I could adjust the code. I found the code for the other two shapes, the sphere and the cylinder. Then I entered the code for the other two shapes(cylinder, sphere) and at last I found the code from the links to enter the voice and the snow. For the voice, I changed some commands to 'start' - 'stop", to start and stop snowing with the shapes.
